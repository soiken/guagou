Apparently people have liked some of the things I've made so far. Here's one thing I've decided to give out; I figured it could be helpful for those who want to know where things are.

What is it?
- A slain tracker
- Keep track of mobs you've come across

How to use it?
- Should install itself when you install the package. If not, use mdb redo
- mdb slain will print a list of things you've slain, and where.
- mdb slain (area) will print a list of things you've slain matching the provided request.
- mdb pks will print a list of players you've slain.

- mdb lookup area (area) will print a list of mobs you've come across in the specific area, as well as the room num they were first spotted in.
- mdb lookup mob (mob) similar to the above, but prints a list of mobs matching specified request, and the area they're in as well as the room number first spotted.
- mdb clear (thing) will remove things from the database, matching the specified request. This only removes from the db, not the slain tracker.
