Enchantments are skills focused around infusing magical powers into existing items, or creating
magical items themselves. Below is a list of the functions these powerful abilities can create.

Created Items
-------------
Special items created by Enchanting.

  Worrystone
  - When TOUCHed, it may do one of four things: heal health, heal mana, cure an
    affliction, or nothing.

  Brooch of the Underking
  - When WORN, will allow the wearer to see all deaths within the realm.
    Identical to the deathsight defence, but works while the wearer is dead.

  Spiritbulb and Essencecap
  - Essencecaps deal with necromantic essence, spiritbulbs with devotion. When
    created the items possess no energy, but DRAIN ESSENCECAP/SPIRITBULB will
    draw a portion of the appropriate energy into the bulb and cause it to glow.
    One can then EAT the item to replenish the energy.

  An Anklet of Lleis
  - When worn, the anklet of Lleis will increase healing effects done on the
    wearer by 25%. This only effects healing done by other people.

  Whirlwind of Tanixalthas
  - You must WIELD the item before you can use it, and then THROW it, to create
    either a vicious wind or a tempestuous geyser, which will knock any people
    flying overhead to the ground.

  Shimmering Orb
  - Simply having this item in your inventory will prevent the APPRAISE ability
    (Vision) from working on you.

  A Silver Ancestral Pendant
  - The ancestral pendant will allow a Warden's simulacrum to wear it for
    additional protection against attacks, as described in AB COMMUNION
    REQUISITION.

  Beacon Capsule
  - Two are needed. The first you simply DROP into a room you wish to return to.
    To use the second, you must THROW BEACON/TOTEM AT GROUND to instantly travel
    to the first, which will destroy both. It is important to note that this
    will only work within a very small range.

  Dreamcharm
  - When holding this item in your inventory, you will recover endurance more
    quickly while you SLEEP.

  Lunar Eclipse Medallion
  - When WORN, it will reverse most of the affects of the constellations on you.
    (See HELP CONSTELLATIONS)

  Time Sphere
  - When you THROW SPHERE/SHELL AT GROUND, it will slow the recovery of balance
    and equilibrium for everyone in the room, provided that there are a minimum
    of four people present.

  Bag of Stasis
  - Used like a normal container, items inside will decay half as quickly. Only
    five items can fit inside the bag of stasis.

  Rainstick
  - Passively increases willpower and mana regeneration during meditation. You
    need only keep it in your inventory.

  Gemdust
  - This will break down gemstones into its dust form, receiving 100x of the
    appropriate dust.

  Eye of Lanos
  - When wearing this item upon your person, it will grant you the ability to
    discern the effects of random curing abilities used in the room with you.
  
  Aegis
  - Only of use to a trained mage, this enchantment is used as an ancient magical
    defence structure, and can be etched with glyphs and attuned.

  Elemental
  - THROW this magical crystal onto the ground to summon a random miniature
    elemental to hunt together with you. When their ylem energy runs out, they
    expire.
    (See ELEMENTAL on interaction capabilities.)

Altered Items
-------------

These enchantments are applied to an existing item. The following enchantments are placed on
specific items:

  Augment
  - Augmentations are applied to weapons or armour, and will raise one point
    in every stat. This may be done up to three times, but each augmentation
    will subtract five Aetolian weeks from the decay time of weapons, and seven
    Aetolian weeks from the decay time of armour.

  Meteor
  - Applicable only to arrows. Meteor arrows can be shot into the air at your
    target from anywhere in the same area as long as they are outdoors, and
    will break through the victim's shield defence. Flame arrows work like
    regular arrows, but will set the target on fire. Enchanted arrows cannot
    be envenomed.

  Cold Pocket
  - This enchantment is applied to containers (packs, bags, etc.) and will
    make the food inside decay seven times slower.

The following enchantments may be placed on any item created with Jewelcrafting. (HELP
JEWELCRAFTING)

  Firelash
  - This enchantment is quite versatile. When pointed at a player, a firelash
    enchantment will deal fire damage. You may also damage a player in an
    adjacent room. You may point it in a direction blocked by an icewall to melt
    it. Finally, you may point it directly at an icewall to remove it. This last
    syntax will choose a wall at random if there is more than one in the room.
  - Usage: POINT FIRELASH AT <target>
           POINT FIRELASH <direction> AT <target>
           POINT FIRELASH AT ICEWALL
           POINT FIRELASH <direction>
  - Uses: 60

  Firewall
  - Pointing in a direction will create a deadly firewall. People who pass
    through the firewall will lose their mass defense if they have it. If not,
    it will set them on fire.
  - Usage: POINT FIREWALL <direction>
  - Uses: 60

  Icewall
  - Pointing an item enchanted with icewall will, as the name implies, produce
    an impenetrable wall of ice in the given direction. This wall will prevent
    many means of travel through that exit.
  - Usage: POINT ICEWALL <direction>
  - Uses: 60

  Frostblast
  - Pointing an item with this enchantment at a player will strip away their
    caloric defence, or freeze them completely if they are not protected by it.
    Alternatively, point this at an existing firewall or in a direction to
    extinguish them.
  - Usage: POINT FROSTBLAST AT <target>
           POINT FROSTBLAST <direction>
           POINT FROSTBLAST AT FIREWALL
  - Uses: 60

  Resistances
  - This enchantment will confer a 10% resistance bonus to the appropriate
    damage type when it is worn. This enchantment will last 60 Aetolian months.
    Types: Fire, Magic, Electric, Cold

  Allsight
  - You may touch an item with this enchantment to see and hear normally while
    deaf and blind. This enchantment is identical to the mindseye defence.
  - Uses: 60

  Waterwalking
  - When TOUCHed, a Waterwalking item will allow you to move through water
    rooms without having to swim. This defence will last for one hour. You may
    only use normal movement with waterwalking (e.g. no dashing, etc.).
  - Usage: TOUCH WATERWALKING
  - Uses: 30

  Purity
  - When WORN, an item enchanted with Purity will passively and periodically
    cure an affliction caused by venoms at random.

  Pestilence
  - Pointing an item with Pestilence will afflict your victim with a random
    affliction.
  - Usage: POINT PESTILENCE AT <target>
  - Uses: 120
