Mining is the ability to extract metal ores from the earth. It is a fully realised skillset centred
around establishing and staffing your own mining operations and navigating the dangers of the under-
deeps in order to harvest resources from the earth.

OBTAINING THE SKILL OF MINING
=============================

To learn the skill of Mining, seek out Philbert in the Gorshire Mining Syndicate headquarters
(v70606). For a cost of 10,000 gold, you may simply LEARN ABILITY OF MINING FROM PHILBERT to pick up 
the skill. It is then learned with lessons like any other.

* You must have an Agriculture skill slot available in order to do this. See HELP AGRICULTURE for
details on slots.

Philbert will also supply a variety of basic equipment from both the Syndicate headquarters in Lodi
and at the various outposts across the world.

GETTING STARTED WITH MINING
===========================

Once you've obtained the skill and picked up your equipment, you'll want to head to your city's
outpost. Mines operate on their own maps in a similar way to Farming, but the maps are significantly 
larger.

Bloodloch   | The Mhojave Desert   | v53195
Duiran      | The Western Ithmia   | v68504
Enorian     | The Shamtota Hills   | v68550
Spinesreach | The Telfinne Caverns | v68946

After arriving there, you simply ENTER OUTPOST and you can begin searching for a desirable mine
using the PROSPECT ability.

PROSPECTING
===========
The PROSPECT command (AB MINING PROSPECT) allows you to discern the ores available in a specific
location, and in what volume.

PROSPECT AREA allows you to scan the whole map at once and see an at a glance view of what ore is
most common on which tile.

* The ore presence on each tile is set until the next Howling, at which point it will be rerolled.

OPENING A MINE
==============

Utilise the MINES ability (AB MINING MINES) to delve into a mine and explore it.

If you wish to keep the mine that you've just opened, return to the surface with LEAVE MINE and
CLAIM MINE WITH DEED.

You are then ready to get started! AB MINING OFFICE is the place to begin!

DEEDS
=====

There is currently a limit of one Mining deed per person. This is obtained when the skill is
acquired.

This limit may be relaxed in the future as knowledge and use of Mining becomes more widespread.

DEPOSITS AND VEINS
==================

You will find ores in two different states within mines: deposits, and veins. Deposits appear in the
room like a normal item and can be mined with your pickaxe. Whereas veins are tiles on the map that 
must be mined by your Gnome workers. Refer to AB MINING PICKAXE and AB MINING VEINS for more 
details.

GRAPHICAL MAP
=============
At this time, there's no graphical map for Mining. The challenges posed are significantly higher for
Mining, but it is something that may occur in future.
