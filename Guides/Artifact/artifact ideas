Level 3 crit
Everything listed in class artis except hunting damage
level 3 Health + Mana sip bonus
Armor and shield arti
Health and Mana Regen (is this a trap?)
Health and Mana boost level 3
Magic resistance ring
Shield resistance arti - which one?
Robes of magic - does this affect clotting?
Full set arti vials pipes bandages

Magic potence boosts crux too
Yes mana_boon affects clotting

So there's the artifact collar listed in class artis, there's the hunting damage bonus, is there a third arti that boosts damage?
