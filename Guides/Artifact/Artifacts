Artifacts are items imbued with special powers that can grant you an edge in everyday life. They are
almost always purchased with credits or iron coins, and are bound to you upon purchase. Should you 
lose the item somewhere, it will eventually return to your inventory. Refer to HELP ARTIFACTS for 
more information about the mystical items.


PURCHASING POWERS
-----------------

Here is an overview of the syntax and what they do. In all instances where ARTIFACT PURCHASE is
used, you can use AP for shorthand.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE LIST [filter]
View the list of artifacts we have available for purchase. Can supply one or more filters to narrow
the list down if you desire.
Possible filters:
 FULL       - Show you a description of what the artifact does.
 UNOWNED    - Shows only artifacts you don't already own.
 AFFORDABLE - Shows only artifacts you can currently afford.
 UNDER <#>  - Shows only artifacts whose cost is under that value
 OVER <#>   - Shows only artifacts whose cost is over that value.
 <category> - Show only artifacts from that category.
 <search>   - Show only artifacts that match that search term.
e.g.
 AP LIST OFFENSIVE UNDER 500
   Would list offensive artifacts under 500 credits.
 AP LIST OVER 100 UNDER 400
   Would list all artifacts between 100 to 400 credits.
 AP LIST WINGS
   Would list all artifacts that match the word 'wings'.
   
ARTIFACT INFO <artifact>
View extended information about a particular artifact.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE <artifact> [ON <item|POWERORB>]
Adds an artifact to your artifact shopping cart. This can used for buying a new item, buying a power
on an existing item, or upgrading a power you already have. You can use either the artifact's 
database number, or its power name.
e.g. AP 312
     AP CONSTITUTION LEVEL 2 ON CLOAK1234
     AP ELUSION ON CLOAK1234

For artifacts that have no pre-made item, they must be placed upon a item you own. If you wish to
gift the artifact or do not own an item to place it upon, you can buy it upon an orb of power, 
however the artifact will not function until it is transferred onto a valid item.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE APPLY <token>
Applies one of the variety of artifact tokens we have (e.g. discount). If you have multiple items in
your cart, the tokens will apply themselves to whatever will give you the most return. i.e. a 33% 
discount token will always pick a 2k cr arti over a 500cr arti.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE CLEAR
Empty your shopping cart.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE CHECKOUT [CONFIRM]
Review everything in your artifact shopping cart, and confirm your purchase.

ARTIFACT PURCHASE HISTORY
-------------------------
You can view a history of your artifact purchases using RECEIPTS.

ARTIFACT POWER TRANSFERS
------------------------
You may transfer powers from one artifact to another, if the power is transferable and the item type
is suitable for the weapon power.

Artifact power transfers cost 25 Bound Credits, and if the artifact from which a power is being
transferred has no powers left after a transfer, it will be destroyed.
There is no cost when transferring from an orb of power.

ARTIFACT TRANSFER (power) FROM (old artifact) TO (new artifact)

ARTIFACT SHARING
----------------
All artifacts will reset into your inventory on a very regular basis, which means that they cannot
be loaned out very long, but that they also cannot be stolen for very long. They'll also never 
decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone else's inventory, so do not buy artifacts of any 
kind if you intend to sell them. It is impossible to permanently transfer an artifact, especially 
between characters under the same registration.

ARTIFACT TATTOOS
----------------
Inwards from the main hall of the Artifact shop (at Qeddwyn) is an Artifact tattoo parlour, where
you can purchase silver ink tattoos. These have unlimited uses and will never fade. They can also 
never be wiped off or removed. To buy the tattoo, BUY (tattoo) ON (body part).
