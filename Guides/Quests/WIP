I have a quest list that I want to automate using mudlet triggers, aliases and scripts, note that since the quest list might be updated later, make it as convenient for me to edit if the quests updates

here are some commands, functions and gmcp actions u can refer when creating this:
1. sending "PATH TRACK (area)" can reach the area, for example PATH TRACK ALAQSII will start walking to ALAQSII
2. gmcp.Room.Info.area will return "area", this can be used check if the character has arrvied the correct area before executing the next command/action, please make the area upper case so it can be better matched
3. when the area is checked and verified being same as the quest required area, you can use "snd_bashArea()"" which will kill all enemies in the location
4. when the quest require giving an npc or talking to an npc, you can use "demonwalker:init()" to run the area and continuosly and using "gmcp.Char.Items.List.items" will return an array of items/npcs in the current room, here is an example:
{
  items = { {
      id = "3277",
      name = "The Inner Gate of Spinesreach"
    }, {
      id = "43803",
      name = "a sturdy wooden pallet"
    }, {
      id = "70108",
      name = "a simple veranda"
    }},
  location = "room"
}
5. if you can partially match the name with the npc name from the quest list below meaning the npc is found, use "demonwalker:stop()" to stop run the area. For example if you are looking for the npc "Seviel", for Quest 2A below, you can "PATH TRACK ARBOTHIA" and after you verify the current area is ARBOTHIA, you can use "demonwalker:init()" and keep running in ARBOTHIA and keep running "gmcp.Char.Items.List.items" to check for the npc. 
6. The same goes for items that need to be picked up, for example you need to pick up ash/ashes for Quest 3A, if the word ash/ashes is found in "gmcp.Char.Items.List.items" array, then you can send "get (id)" found from "gmcp.Char.Items.List.items" array
7. sending "give (item) to (npc)" will give the item from inventory to npc, note that each time its sent it will only give 1 piece of the item, for example "give corpses to hunter" will only give 1 corpse, you can keep giving until you see "You hold no (item)" in this scenario you will see "You hold no corpse" 
8. sending "greet (npc)" will greet the npc as requested by some quests
