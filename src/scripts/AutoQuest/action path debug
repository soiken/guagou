Rain pours down from the sky, the dawn's light filtering dimly through the cloud cover. A missing
child poster has been tacked up here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on 
the ground. A harvested hemp plant has been carelessly left here. An indigo nightfire butterfly 
flits about randomly. 
You see exits leading east and southwest.
[HINT]: This is an interesting hemp plant. That might make for some great rope!
